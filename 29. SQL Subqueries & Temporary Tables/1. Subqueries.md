# Sub Queries

## Definition

**Sub Query** also calked **inner Queries** or **Nested Queries** are tool for performing operations ins multiple steps. It allow you to answer more complex questions than you can with a single database table

**Example:**

``` SQL
SELECT channel,
       AVG(event_count) AS avg_event_count
FROM(SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', occurred_at) AS day,
            channel,
            COUNT(*) AS event_count
     FROM web_events
     GROUP BY 1,2
) sub
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

### Sub Queries in Conditional Logic

Sub Queries are useful in **conditional logic**, in conjunction with **WHERE** or **JOIN** clauses, or in the **WHEN** portion of a **CASE** statement.

**For example:** You might want to return only orders that occurred in tha same month as _Parch and Posey_ first over.

``` SQL
SELECT *
    FROM orders
    WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month',occurred_at) =
(SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month',MIN(occurred_at)) AS min_month
FROM orders)
  ORDER BY occurred_at
```

**Note:**

* This query works because the result of above query is only **one** cell. Most conditional logic will work with sub queries containing one-cell results

* But **IN** is the only type of conditional logic that will work when the inner query contains multiple results

### Multiple Sub Queries

Consider we want to know the top channel used by each account. Imagine we also want to know how often that channel was used.
We can break this down into a couple of different table and nest them within one another using sub queries.
In result we have one column for account ID, web event that's associated with the maximum for that particular account and column for how often that web event occurred.

```SQL
SELECT t3.id, t3.name, t3.channel, t3.ct
FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) ct
      FROM accounts a
      JOIN web_events w
      ON a.id = w.account_id
      GROUP BY 1,2,3
     ) t3
JOIN (SELECT t1.id,
             t1.name,
             MAX(ct) max_chan
      FROM (SELECT a.id , a.name , w.channel, COUNT(*) ct
            FROM accounts a
            JOIN web_events w
            ON a.id = w.account_id
            GROUP BY 1,2,3
            ORDER BY 1
           ) t1
      GROUP BY 1,2
      ORDER BY 1
     ) t2
ON t2.id = t3.id AND t2.max_chan = t3.ct
ORDER BY t3.id, t3.ct;
```

WHERE w.account_id = (SELECT t1.id
                      FROM (SELECT a.id,
                                   a.name,
                                   SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent
                            FROM accounts a
                            JOIN orders o
                            ON a.id = o.account_id
                            GROUP BY 1,2
                            ORDER BY 3 DESC

                  t1 )
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC`

5. What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of **total_amt_usd** for the top 10 total spending **accounts**?
**ANS From Solutions:**
`SELECT AVG(tot_spent)
FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
      FROM orders o
      JOIN accounts a
      ON a.id = o.account_id
      GROUP BY a.id, a.name
      ORDER BY 3 DESC
       LIMIT 10) temp;`
**My ANS:**
`SELECT a.id,
        a.name,
        AVG(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE o.account_id IN (SELECT t1.id
                       FROM (SELECT a.id,
                                    a.name,
                                    SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent
                             FROM accounts a
                             JOIN orders o
                             ON a.id = o.account_id
                             GROUP BY 1,2
                             ORDER BY 3 DESC
                             LIMIT 10
                           ) t1
                      )
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1 DESC`

6. What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of **total_amt_usd**, including only the companies that spent more per order, on average, than the average of all orders.
`SELECT AVG(avg_amt)
 FROM (SELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_amt
       FROM orders o
       GROUP BY 1
       HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
                                      FROM orders o)) temp_table;`

## WITH / Common Table Expression

* One problem with _sub queries_ is that they can make you **lengthy** and **difficult** to read.

* **Common Table Expression** or **CTEs** can help break you query into separate components so that your query logic is more easily readable.

**For Example:**

``` SQL
WITH events AS (
     SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occured_at) AS day,
            channel,
            COUNT(*) AS event_count
     FROM web_events
)

SELECT channel
       AVG(event_count) AS avg_event_count
FROM events
GROUP BY 1
ORDER By 2 DESC
```

**Note:**

* We need to **define** any common table expressions at the **beginning** of the query in order to use them in our final query at the **bottom**.

* Each common table expression gets **alias** just like **sub query**.
