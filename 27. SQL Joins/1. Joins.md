# SQL JOIN

## INNER JOINs

Notice **every** JOIN we have done up to this point has been an **INNER JOIN**. That is, we have always pulled rows only if they exist as a match across two tables.

Our new **JOIN**s allow us to pull rows that might only exist in one of the two tables. This will introduce a new data type called **NULL**. This data type will be discussed in detail in the next lesson.

### Quick Note

You might see the SQL syntax of

``` SQL
LEFT OUTER JOIN
```

OR

``` SQL
RIGHT OUTER JOIN
```

These are the exact same commands as the **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN** we learned about in the previous video.

## OUTER JOINS

The last type of join is a full outer join. This will return the inner join result set, as well as any unmatched rows from either of the two tables being joined.

Again this returns rows that **do not match** one another from the two tables. The use cases for a full outer join are **very rare**.

You can see examples of outer joins at the link [here](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/perform-a-full-outer-join.php) and a description of the rare use cases [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2094793/when-is-a-good-situation-to-use-a-full-outer-join). We will not spend time on these given the few instances you might need to use them.

Similar to the above, you might see the language **FULL OUTER JOIN**,which is the same as **OUTER JOIN**.
