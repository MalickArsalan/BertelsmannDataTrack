# Why SQL

1. **Data integrity is ensured** - only the data you want entered is entered, and only certain users are able to enter data into the database.

2. **Data can be accessed quickly** - SQL allows you to obtain results very quickly from the data stored in a database. Code can be optimized to quickly pull results.

3. **Data is easily shared** - multiple individuals can access data stored in a database, and the data is the same for all users allowing for consistent results for anyone with access to your database.
